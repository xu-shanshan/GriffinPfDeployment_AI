## Identified Issues & Recommendations

### 1. Technical Implementation Issues
1. Interaction Design Issues

- **Problem**: Modal z-index conflicts

Location: service-detail.html Pipeline Management Modal
Impact: Modal hidden behind sidebar on certain screen sizes
Solution: Proper CSS stacking context (z-index: 1050)

```css
/* Current Issue */
.modal { z-index: 50; }        /* Too low */
.sidebar { z-index: 1000; }    /* Higher than modal */

/* Solution Applied */
#pipelineManagementModal { z-index: 1050; } /* Above sidebar */
```
**Status**: Fixed in latest version

- **Problem**: Inconsistent Loading States

Location: All pages lack loading indicators
Impact: Users unsure if actions are processing
Solution: Skeleton screens and progress indicators

Recommendation: 
- Implement skeleton screens for data loading
- Button loading states for actions
- Progress indicators for long-running operations (deployments)

- **Problem**: Limited Error Handling
Location: No error states shown in current prototype
Impact: Users won't understand failure scenarios
Solution: Error boundaries and user-friendly error messages
Recommendation:
```typescript
// Error state examples needed
interface ErrorState {
  type: 'network' | 'validation' | 'deployment' | 'config';
  message: string;
  recoverable: boolean;
  actions: string[];
}
```

**Recommendations for React Implementation**:
```typescript
// Performance optimization strategy
const optimizations = {
  codesplitting: 'Route-based lazy loading',
  stateMgmt: 'Redux Toolkit with RTK Query',
  updates: 'Optimistic updates with rollback',
  search: 'Debounced search (300ms)',
  lists: 'Virtual scrolling for large datasets'
};
```

### 5. Security & Data Handling

#### Current Approach
- Static mock data embedded in HTML
- No authentication implementation visible
- No input validation evident

#### Production Requirements
